Snprintf implementation for ADBI.

Unless ADBI IDK tools are mostly independent from toolchain, and cannot take advantege of libc standard library there is need to implement some helper functions. 

Usage:
Make sure ADBICC env variable is set to valid path to gcc. If not:
export ADBICC=/path/to/gcc-4.9/bin/aarch64-linux-android-gcc

Compile:
mkinj --library adbi_snprintf adbi_snprintf.c
